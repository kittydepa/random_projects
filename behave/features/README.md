## Notes
You may get an error from the terminal if you try to exectue `behave` and have multiple versions of Python installed.
<br>
Here is a help article by Real Python that explains more on why this happens, and how to address it [here](https://realpython.com/lessons/why-cant-python-find-my-modules/).
<br><br>
<b>TLDR;</b> try installing `behave` again by running `python -m pip install behave`.
<br>
Also ensure that you have set your Python scripts to `PATH`.
